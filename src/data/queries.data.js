    question: " What do multiple arrow functions mean in JavaScript?",
    description:
      "I have an action that updates the notification state of my application. Usually, this notification will be an error or info of some sort. I need to then dispatch another action after 5 seconds that will return the notification state to the initial one, so no notification. The main reason behind this is to provide functionality where notifications disappear automatically after 5 seconds.",

        answer: "The above code explains what is going on with multiple arrow operators. It returns a function which in turn accepts a parameter, the nested returned function maintains the state of x. This methodology is called currying.",

        answer: "We may have come across arrow functions in javascript and are almost saturated learning about the difference between normal functions and arrow functions, the difference between ES5 and ES6 and everything that is connected to it. But everytime we come across multiple arrows in a single function, we keep struggling - or it could just be a  problem. Here goes, what multiple arrows in a function mean.",
